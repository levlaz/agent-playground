Given a directory full of html files: $reports 

Each HTML file in this directory is a QA report for a dagger module. Read each file and create an $index file called index.html that includes a table that looks like this: 

| Module Name | Brief Description | Red X if failing, Green Check if Passing | Link to the full report | 

!imprtant this is a production implementation so make sure you actually read each file remember the information to add to the index. Also make sure there is one entry for each file that you read. Don't stop until this task is completed.

Save and return the $index file once you are done.
