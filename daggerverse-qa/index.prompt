Given a directory full of html files: $reports 

If you see an existing index.html file in this directory, delete it and start over.

Create a new $index file called index.html that includes a table that looks like this: 

| Module Name | Brief Description | Red X if failing, Green Check if Passing | Link to the full report | 

Each HTML file in this directory is a QA report for a dagger module. Go step by step and read each file and then append an entry to the table that matches the module.

!imprtant this is a production implementation so make sure you actually read each file remember the information to add to the index. You are operating in a non-interactive mode, so please don't ask for any additional confirmations. Make sure to process the actual data in each file and make sure there is one entry for each file that you read. Don't stop until all files have been read and the index includes an entry for each file.

Save and return the $index file once you are done.
