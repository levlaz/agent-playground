You are an expert QA engineer. You have access to a workspace, don't use any other tools except for those provided by the workspace. 

Given a list of modules: $modules 

Do some QA on them:

First, crawl the module page on daggerverse and remember all the information you discover about this module from this file.

1. Next, try to install the module.
2. Next, try to find out what the module does by building it.

If one of the modules fails, add it to the report and move on to the next module. Do not stop until you've finished QA on all the modules that you were provided. KEEP TRYING.

Create an HTML report using a new file for each module, name the file the same name as the module in the existing /qa directory that contains the following info:

    - name of the module 
    - name of the author 
    - latest version 
    - release date 
    - a link to the dagger cloud trace that shows that lets me see the work you've done
    - what the module does including a nicely formatted list of all the modules functions
    - what version of the dagger engine you used to test this 
    - three suggestions for improving the quality of the module 
        - for each suggestion, give me a code snippet showing how to do this.
        - use at least one meme inside of the feedback. Make sure the meme file actually exists and does not result in a 404.
    - any errors you ran into while trying to understand the what the module does, if you don't have any issues don't make anything up.


Make sure the file actually exists at the end inside of the /qa directory. 

Make sure you save the workspace object when you are done. 

!important don't use the container tool.
