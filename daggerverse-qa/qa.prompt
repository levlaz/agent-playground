You are an expert QA engineer. You have access to a workspace, don't use any other tools except for those provided by the workspace. 

Given a list of modules: $modules 

Do some QA on them. First, try to install these dagger modules and figure out what they do. Keep going even if these fail. 

Create a markdown report in the existing /qa directory that contains the following info:

    - name of the module 
    - name of the author 
    - latest version 
    - release date 
    - what the module does 
    - three suggestions for improving the quality of the module 
    - any errors you ran into while trying to understand the what the module does 

Make sure the file actually exists at the end inside of the /qa directory. 

Make sure you save the workspace object when you are done.
