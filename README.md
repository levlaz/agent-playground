# Agent Playground

This repository serves as a playground for developing and experimenting with AI agents using [Dagger](https://dagger.io). It provides a space to explore and test various agent architectures, capabilities, and use cases in a containerized environment.

## Overview

Dagger provides a powerful runtime and programming environment for building AI agents with benefits including:
- Reproducible execution
- End-to-end observability
- Multi-model support
- Rapid iteration
- Easy integration

## Features

- Containerized execution for maximum portability and reproducibility
- Command-line and programmatic API access
- Language bindings for Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP, Java, and Rust
- End-to-end tracing of prompts, tool calls, and system operations
- Cross-language extensions
- Platform-independent deployment

## Getting Started

To get started with developing AI agents using Dagger, check out:
- [Dagger AI Agents Documentation](https://docs.dagger.io/ai-agents/)
- [Dagger Agent Examples](https://github.com/dagger/agents)
- [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/KK3AfBP8Gw)

## Example Agents

Here are some example agents built with Dagger that can serve as inspiration:
- [toy-programmer](https://github.com/shykes/toy-programmer) - A simple programmer micro-agent for demo purposes
- [melvin](https://github.com/dagger/agents/tree/main/melvin) - An experimental open-source coding agent
- [multiagent](https://github.com/kpenfound/agents/tree/main/multiagent-demo) - Demo using multiple LLMs to solve problems
- [dockerfile-optimizer](https://github.com/samalba/agents/tree/main/dockerfile-optimizer) - Agent that analyzes and improves Dockerfiles
